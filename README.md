#Wise Old Dog Rescue
Thinkful Front End Web Development Capstone Project to search and find adoptable senior rescue dogs in your area.

##Introduction
Helping rescue dogs have been a passion of mine since I first adopted my dog in 2013. Wise Old Dog Rescue enables you to locate shelters and senior rescue dogs in a searchable zip code. Of all the dogs in need of adoption, senior rescue dogs have the hardest time finding forever homes although they have the most to offer. They are most often housebroken, have basic training and know a few charming tricks. Senior dogs are typically classified as dogs 5 years and older, which means they often have more than half their life ahead of them! The aim of this site is to help connect people with senior rescue dogs in need of forever homes, and bring their best qualities forward so they can be recognized for the great dogs they are.

##Summary
Wise Old Dog Rescue provides a fun, simple search setup with a laid-back layout, while still providing all the necessary information using thoughtfully-designed features. The user enters their zip code in the search box and clicks the Search button. The search button is clicked and the landing page scrolls up to reveal a map with shelter locations marked by paw prints and photos of dogs available for adoption at those shelter locations. The dog photos are labeled with the dog's name and size classification (S-XL). Each dog photo has a pink or blue border to identify the gender of the dog and allows for a click feature that, when clicked, displays the description of the dog written by the shelter at which the dog is being housed. The Contact Shelter link at the bottom of each dog photo takes the user to a contact form for the shelter that is housing that specific dog. The user can reload the page to begin the search process again.

##Technical
- This app was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
- This app utilizes the Petfinder API to access shelter locations and available rescue dog information and the Google Maps API to visually represent the shelter locations on an interactive map.
